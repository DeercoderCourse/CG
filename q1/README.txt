GUIDE


** For this question, I just implement some dot product and cross product calculation to judge whether they are intersected or not:
	* for intersected, just draw the intersection, since here using their p(t) = (1-t)p1+(t)p2, so if there is some common value, then they’re intersected
	* for those doesn’t intersect, just use the default value or presetting, then we should know it not.

For the drawing here, I use a simple example that contains some pre-setting coordinates, we could change it in the code as well to get other results.
