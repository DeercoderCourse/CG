GUIDE:

for this question, input the model with a .json format, since it contains the model definition, and output should be the model.

Input are the four vertices, and we could set the z value to be height.

Then generate all the remaining nodes, including the four edges on the bottom, four on the top which are the original points, and here I also output the edges with start point and end points.

So my output model contains the exact information of the new model for the prism.
