GUIDE:


for this example, I used the three.js to generate the rotating cube.

1) generate the shape with scene, camera and geometry.

2) use the animation function to do the rotation.

3) then use the moving of plane to generate three grey plane.

4) I created 3 lights in the code to do the shadowing. (incomplete, shadow)
