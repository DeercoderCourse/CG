GUIDE:

for this question, use some methods to calculate the epistle 

1) we could get the equation of epistle = r - rcos(pi/n), so once it is given, we could easily get the value

2) for the drawing, it is easy to the cord of the polygon, it should be 2*rsin(pi/n).

3) first, I choose a point in the circle, then starting that, I draw another circle that has the radius equals to the 2)â€™s chord

4) only draw the intersected points that on the new circle and original one. These points are the vertices for the polygon

5) do it iteratively that we can get the final shape.


In my example, it used a very general way, so we can choose n in code and some numbers, then it will display another shape. Due to time limit, I just give a short example of n = 8.
