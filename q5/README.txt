GUIDE:


for this question, we should judge whether they are exactly in the plane or approximation.

1) first get the plane function for the first three nodes, since we know that they can ensure a plane,(assume they’re not in the same line, judge it and if not changes some points position)

2) judge the distance of other vertices, that to the plane. For the rest of plane, calculate the average, if it is less than 1, then we assume it’s very near the plane and regard it EXACT, otherwise, we know they’re approximately in the plane.


3) give all the judgement and result. We can add many vertices in the program and test the   example.
